1,I pay for the monthly pass... And I am pissed off because it won't connect. And yes I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I've turned my phone one and off.... I needed up using Doordash with no problems only it cost me more money because I don't have a pass there. I'd like my 10 bucks back at this point. Uber needs help and no matter who I email I never hear anything back.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
2,"After half a year, the app didn't improve. Application is full of bugs. Even cannot register in the system. A Year ago it didn't accept my email address, half a year ago it did, but didn't show the keyboard for the first name/last name fields. Half a year later (oct 2020) still the same issue.

3,Worst app. Doesn't even run properly. App tries to connect to server but can't. After half an hour finally connects and asks for address and looks for food and bang no response. Just the same screen with address option. Looks like it is searching for food in Mars that's why there is no food around me. And the same process repeat again and again.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

I have wanted to order Starbucks for delivery, sometimes, due to health reasons, I cannot drive all the time. The app will tell me "" no drivers available""!!

I have reported these mistakes to uber and nothing is ever done about it. The other day I spent $26 and only got one item worth $4, of course when I reported this I get no response whatsoever. I'd recommend you just go get your food yourself if you want to have your correct order.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
8,This app is either glitchy af and/or their drivers are incompetent. Waited 3 HOURS for food that never came. My card is still showing the authorization for the transaction.

Further, they add a Service Fee, a Delivery Fee and then ask for a TIP of 15%. Too many surcharges. I would have picked it myself if I was aware of the surcharges before placing the order.

Further, they add a Service Fee, a Delivery Fee and then ask for a TIP of 15%. Too many surcharges. I would have picked it myself if I was aware of the surcharges before placing the order.

Go for any of them except this one",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

You need to ensure the quality control of restaurants, if I get old and dry food that I cannot eat, I deserve all my money back. I've had to throw out food on more than 2 occasions.

I check Play store and install latest update. Seems to fix this 'sentient' app behaviour. Lo and behold, this evening, I open WhatsApp and suddenly UberEats opens!!",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
484,"I won't say I've never had an issue with the app. But I will say that any issue I do have for the most part is quickly resolved. I use uber alot, for rides, bikes, and food and the few times I do have a complaint uber support has been nothing but helpful. I used to use posrmates, door dash, grub hub, and all that stuff but uber has one monthly fee and their couriers have MUCH better customer service. They've added many more restaurants and there are so many options to choose from. Love it!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars
485,"Very bad at tracking issues with orders and needs the user to actively give feedback to inform about obvious problems which should be auto detected and makes it even more frustrating when I have to report that yes, there was a problem, the order took 2 hours to update status and tell me it was cancelled. And then it asks me to rate the support experience. This is not a new issue, I stopped using this a year ago because of the same problem and it's still there.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

489,"Updated: We have a problem most times I use this app - missing items, big delays, etc. But they give out discounts regularly and almost always take action to rectify the problem (usually a part refund), so it is fine as long as you accept the extra hassle of using this over other services. The delivery people are usually nice, at least.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
490,"Nearly useless to me. I find restaurants through Google and if you try to click through order through Uber eats the app tells you the restaurant is too far away despite my current location. Also, it takes about 5 minutes to switch to pick up rather than delivery. Finding a restaurant for pick up is impossible cause you have to use the map. There's no list view. It's gotten to the point that I'd rather call a restaurant that order through Uber eats, particularly for pick up.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
491,"App works fine but the service has been slipping over the past few months. Delayed orders, poor communication, no drivers to pick up orders.

Likely going to switch food courrier services soon.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

494,Great app. Will be helpful if restaurants don't send utensils when not asked for it. The help function is not that helpful.

496,The app interface is really good and easy to search and order. Area of improvement: Estimated order time to delivery is need lot of improvement. Currently the order varies byore than 90-120mins. Service fees is little higher. The restaurants are maybe increasing the item price in Uber when compared to price they show in their website or you call and order them directly.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
497,"Terrible app. I can't put my address so each time I order something I have to call the driver, because messaging submits the message hours later.

Something they don't mention to you. Also their tracker has gotten terrible, randomly moving the driver and its refresh rate is way too long.

You will not be refunded if your order is incorrect or missing an item. Its happened to me several times. Even with proof they will not look into the claim or even have a human respond.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
522,This app sucks ass. They dont update the app that match the restaurants deals so you overpay for your food. On top of that you have to pay for delivery fee plus the wait time to get your food. There is an option to pay extra to get your food quicky but it will cost you $2. I paid the $2 and still took 1 hour for my food to get to me. Its not like i was ordering from a play far away.

You will not be refunded if your order is incorrect or missing an item. Its happened to me several times. Even with proof they will not look into the claim or even have a human respond.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
922,This app sucks ass. They dont update the app that match the restaurants deals so you overpay for your food. On top of that you have to pay for delivery fee plus the wait time to get your food. There is an option to pay extra to get your food quicky but it will cost you $2. I paid the $2 and still took 1 hour for my food to get to me. Its not like i was ordering from a play far away. Burger king was only 10 min away from me.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

How many struggling restaurants have lost orders due to this lazy rushed unsophisticated design.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
1094,Great app. Will be helpful if restaurants don't send utensils when not asked for it. The help function is not that helpful. I eventually found a place where I could add my own query but it was a mission. It also doesn't seem to be possible to change a rating for the delivery person once he has been rated. That would be helpful.,Rated 4 stars out of five stars

1096,The app interface is really good and easy to search and order. Area of improvement: Estimated order time to delivery is need lot of improvement. Currently the order varies byore than 90-120mins. Service fees is little higher. The restaurants are maybe increasing the item price in Uber when compared to price they show in their website or you call and order them directly.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
1097,"Terrible app. I can't put my address so each time I order something I have to call the driver, because messaging submits the message hours later. So, the only good is the delivery tracking, so I can wait for the delivery outside. Ordering is a disaster, accessing the basket is a maze, in fact I order through the website.

Once I finally found a phone number they said they are not taking support calls and hung up! Then when I put it through the help portion they said they would give me a credit and never did! This is the worst customer service ever!!!!!,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
1268,I used it for quite a long time. Last week I got charged double because the promotion got ignored when charging me. Customer support pretty much doesn't care and after a while just keeps sending copy paste messages telling me there's nothing they can do. I honestly am quite disappointed and pretty much done with this company,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

Subscribed to free delivery and stuff and after my first order app is stuck on 2 pages. One for my address and one for map as if i am about to order something. There is back button that takes me back and forth on those two pages. Now i cant even unsub. Which makes it still garbage app. Would give 0 i can,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
1275,"App is fine and food choices are excellent, only rated three stars as it is flawed when there is an issue. Ordered food from a well known establishment but when it arrived not all the items were included. I would have noticed if I got it & sorted there and then. When I raised an issue through the app they said it will take up to 24 hours for a refund of the missing items only. We didn't want a refund we wanted hour food so I had to go back anyway. Who is responsible the driver or Mackies?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
1276,Ordering and looking for food is fine. The issue is setting a primary payment method and being able to change it because I don't seem to be able to.

I tried changing my payment when ordering and it didn't really update on the screen.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars

Yet, when I checked the receipt I realized it was not deducted. There is nothing that i can see in under help for support that I can address this to have corrected. Outside the app I visited the website and tried calling. Dead end! I will never use this app again. It is not for me.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

After some time of waiting (several months) I was able to log in. Then I ordered something and had to put in a payment. Payment entry screen was black background and black text so I had no way of knowing if I put in the correct credit card info. So I scanned card and upon checking out payment could not be verified.

Also, it takes about 5 minutes to switch to pick up rather than delivery. Finding a restaurant for pick up is impossible cause you have to use the map. There's no list view.

Likely going to switch food courrier services soon.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

1294,Great app. Will be helpful if restaurants don't send utensils when not asked for it. The help function is not that helpful. I eventually found a place where I could add my own query but it was a mission. It also doesn't seem to be possible to change a rating for the delivery person once he has been rated.

1296,The app interface is really good and easy to search and order. Area of improvement: Estimated order time to delivery is need lot of improvement. Currently the order varies byore than 90-120mins. Service fees is little higher. The restaurants are maybe increasing the item price in Uber when compared to price they show in their website or you call and order them directly.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars

Also the pick up and delivery isn't that accurate, not all the time atleast it can be very laggy. It's improving tho from what it used to be so it's a sign that they are atleast working on this app, keep up the great work I'm sure on no time this app will be close to perfection. I will revise my review then.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
1443,I have ordered from this app faithfully for the last two years at least. The delivery charges was reasonable until recently. All delivery is 5.00 and up which they try to force you to buy the pass and points accumulates very slowly. I recently switched to Door dash for the last couple of months and they delivery vary from .99 and up. Also double the restaurants and great deals. I just paid 1.99 for a delivery and Uber has same restaurant 5.49 delivery. I decided not to use ubereats.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

Worst part is that I can't tip the delivery guy, as the app keeps giving errors whenever I tap ""add tip"".

So, the only good is the delivery tracking, so I can wait for the delivery outside. Ordering is a disaster, accessing the basket is a maze, in fact I order through the website.

Subscribed to free delivery and stuff and after my first order app is stuck on 2 pages. One for my address and one for map as if i am about to order something. There is back button that takes me back and forth on those two pages. Now i cant even unsub. Which makes it still garbage app. Would give 0 i can,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
1875,"App is fine and food choices are excellent, only rated three stars as it is flawed when there is an issue. Ordered food from a well known establishment but when it arrived not all the items were included. I would have noticed if I got it & sorted there and then. When I raised an issue through the app they said it will take up to 24 hours for a refund of the missing items only. We didn't want a refund we wanted hour food so I had to go back anyway. Who is responsible the driver or Mackies?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
1876,Ordering and looking for food is fine. The issue is setting a primary payment method and being able to change it because I don't seem to be able to.

1894,Great app. Will be helpful if restaurants don't send utensils when not asked for it. The help function is not that helpful.

Worst part is that I can't tip the delivery guy, as the app keeps giving errors whenever I tap ""add tip"".

2048,Just awful. I've tried several times to order food at different times and it won't accept any of my cards.

What good is initial sign up promo that expires soon if I can't use the app?,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
2049,Using in a major market city (Philadelphia). The interface is clunky. The refinements offer little improvement in actually refining the search results. Food trucks listed as $$$$.

2052,Good app but it's expensive. The service fees and delivery fees make me pay 30% more and I don't feel it's worth it because the places are all near me.

If uber eats would let me pick restaurant that are farer then maybe I will see the worth.,Rated 3 stars out of five stars

Ordered food from a well known establishment but when it arrived not all the items were included. I would have noticed if I got it & sorted there and then. When I raised an issue through the app they said it will take up to 24 hours for a refund of the missing items only. We didn't want a refund we wanted hour food so I had to go back anyway. Who is responsible the driver or Mackies?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
2076,Ordering and looking for food is fine. The issue is setting a primary payment method and being able to change it because I don't seem to be able to.

2475,"App is fine and food choices are excellent, only rated three stars as it is flawed when there is an issue. Ordered food from a well known establishment but when it arrived not all the items were included. I would have noticed if I got it & sorted there and then. When I raised an issue through the app they said it will take up to 24 hours for a refund of the missing items only. We didn't want a refund we wanted hour food so I had to go back anyway. Who is responsible the driver or Mackies?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
2476,Ordering and looking for food is fine. The issue is setting a primary payment method and being able to change it because I don't seem to be able to. Removing a card is annoying as I'm stuck loading or getting an error and I can't even tap cancel (when it's stuck loading). I tried changing my payment when ordering and it didn't really update on the screen.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
2477,"The app did not allow me to use a gift card I had added into the app before I ordered. During the order it gave impression my gift card funds would be used along with my credit card info. Yet, when I checked the receipt I realized it was not deducted. There is nothing that i can see in under help for support that I can address this to have corrected. Outside the app I visited the website and tried calling. Dead end! I will never use this app again. It is not for me.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
2478,There was a long period after I signed up that I could not log into UberEats. It kept asking for a phone number and setting up account. After some time of waiting (several months) I was able to log in. Then I ordered something and had to put in a payment. Payment entry screen was black background and black text so I had no way of knowing if I put in the correct credit card info. So I scanned card and upon checking out payment could not be verified. Even though information was right.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
2479,"I've been using uber eats for over a year. Despite couple of bugs every now and then, the app is easy to navigate. The restaurants let you know if they're short on anything then allow you to choose something else. Delivery men are polite and nice. I like that you can change the tip amount after the delievery. To sum up, I've had the best experience with uber eats compared to other apps of this kind.",Rated 5 stars out of five stars

I pick another restaurant, get my order together, and now the app does nothing when I click to finish the order. So I go get on my laptop to try that way (previously was on my phone). And on my laptop, the website tells me I don't have a mobile number associated with my account, and I should DL the app. We ended up using a different food delivery svc.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

Edit cart is not straight ahead, normally I need to shutdown the app, reopen it, clear the cart and reorder with the changes I wanted! There is also some menus I feel hard to complete, e.g. if a restaurant offers free drinks, normally I don't have the option to choose the same two drinks, instead I have to order different drinks, etc.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
2483,"First time I installed app earlier this week on S7 mobile, it worked well. I found experience of watching first order in progress reliable and cool. A couple of days ago, however, anytime I want to open WhatsApp, UberEats decides it wants to open too, along with the homepage on Chrome! App doesn't have these permissions whatsoever! I check Play store and install latest update. Seems to fix this 'sentient' app behaviour. Lo and behold, this evening, I open WhatsApp and suddenly UberEats opens!!",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
2484,"I won't say I've never had an issue with the app. But I will say that any issue I do have for the most part is quickly resolved. I use uber alot, for rides, bikes, and food and the few times I do have a complaint uber support has been nothing but helpful. I used to use posrmates, door dash, grub hub, and all that stuff but uber has one monthly fee and their couriers have MUCH better customer service. They've added many more restaurants and there are so many options to choose from. Love it!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars

And then it asks me to rate the support experience. This is not a new issue, I stopped using this a year ago because of the same problem and it's still there.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

2490,"Nearly useless to me. I find restaurants through Google and if you try to click through order through Uber eats the app tells you the restaurant is too far away despite my current location. Also, it takes about 5 minutes to switch to pick up rather than delivery. Finding a restaurant for pick up is impossible cause you have to use the map. There's no list view. It's gotten to the point that I'd rather call a restaurant that order through Uber eats, particularly for pick up.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
2491,"App works fine but the service has been slipping over the past few months. Delayed orders, poor communication, no drivers to pick up orders.

Likely going to switch food courrier services soon.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

How many struggling restaurants have lost orders due to this lazy rushed unsophisticated design.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
2494,Great app. Will be helpful if restaurants don't send utensils when not asked for it. The help function is not that helpful. I eventually found a place where I could add my own query but it was a mission. It also doesn't seem to be possible to change a rating for the delivery person once he has been rated. That would be helpful.,Rated 4 stars out of five stars

2496,The app interface is really good and easy to search and order. Area of improvement: Estimated order time to delivery is need lot of improvement. Currently the order varies byore than 90-120mins. Service fees is little higher. The restaurants are maybe increasing the item price in Uber when compared to price they show in their website or you call and order them directly.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
2497,"Terrible app. I can't put my address so each time I order something I have to call the driver, because messaging submits the message hours later. So, the only good is the delivery tracking, so I can wait for the delivery outside. Ordering is a disaster, accessing the basket is a maze, in fact I order through the website. Why don't you just copy any of the other successful apps out there?",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

2499,Great app to get food and the worst when something goes wrong. We ordered a meal from Steers which took forever to arrive.

2648,Just awful. I've tried several times to order food at different times and it won't accept any of my cards. There is nothing wrong with my cards yet I keep getting the same message that something went wrong and the app never identifies the problem or how to correct. What good is initial sign up promo that expires soon if I can't use the app?,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
2649,Using in a major market city (Philadelphia). The interface is clunky. The refinements offer little improvement in actually refining the search results. Food trucks listed as $$$$.

2652,Good app but it's expensive. The service fees and delivery fees make me pay 30% more and I don't feel it's worth it because the places are all near me.

If uber eats would let me pick restaurant that are farer then maybe I will see the worth.,Rated 3 stars out of five stars

Ordered food from a well known establishment but when it arrived not all the items were included. I would have noticed if I got it & sorted there and then. When I raised an issue through the app they said it will take up to 24 hours for a refund of the missing items only. We didn't want a refund we wanted hour food so I had to go back anyway. Who is responsible the driver or Mackies?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
2676,Ordering and looking for food is fine. The issue is setting a primary payment method and being able to change it because I don't seem to be able to.

2905,New* The support is horrible and honestly they dont even read what you type in support chat and for 2 day i keep sending message to support and they keep trying to close it and or didn't even answer... i have all the screen shots.... i originally give the app 5 start but they changed my mind to 1 star...,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
2906,Surprisingly confusing and hard to navigate for such a big company's App. Also seems prone to not loading some options. Should be easier to tailor ordering instructions - watch out as it's easy to accidentally repeat the instructions from previous order. Also doesn't tell me how far away my order/driver is as you might expect.,Rated 3 stars out of five stars

Something they don't mention to you. Also their tracker has gotten terrible, randomly moving the driver and its refresh rate is way too long.

Payment entry screen was black background and black text so I had no way of knowing if I put in the correct credit card info. So I scanned card and upon checking out payment could not be verified. Even though information was right.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

The restaurants let you know if they're short on anything then allow you to choose something else. Delivery men are polite and nice. I like that you can change the tip amount after the delievery. To sum up, I've had the best experience with uber eats compared to other apps of this kind.",Rated 5 stars out of five stars

I pick another restaurant, get my order together, and now the app does nothing when I click to finish the order. So I go get on my laptop to try that way (previously was on my phone). And on my laptop, the website tells me I don't have a mobile number associated with my account, and I should DL the app. We ended up using a different food delivery svc.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

Edit cart is not straight ahead, normally I need to shutdown the app, reopen it, clear the cart and reorder with the changes I wanted! There is also some menus I feel hard to complete, e.g. if a restaurant offers free drinks, normally I don't have the option to choose the same two drinks, instead I have to order different drinks, etc.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars

3252,Good app but it's expensive. The service fees and delivery fees make me pay 30% more and I don't feel it's worth it because the places are all near me.

Ordered food from a well known establishment but when it arrived not all the items were included. I would have noticed if I got it & sorted there and then. When I raised an issue through the app they said it will take up to 24 hours for a refund of the missing items only. We didn't want a refund we wanted hour food so I had to go back anyway. Who is responsible the driver or Mackies?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
3276,Ordering and looking for food is fine. The issue is setting a primary payment method and being able to change it because I don't seem to be able to.

3511,"Although this service is better than most. They are still pretty bad, if you reach platinum you get a price fix for uber but that price will be fixed even if its cheaper without. Something they don't mention to you. Also their tracker has gotten terrible, randomly moving the driver and its refresh rate is way too long. And don't get me started on how it won't notify you that your order has arrived unless you are on the app. And even then you need to wait for it to refresh. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

I want a refund but Reporting this recently is becoming increasingly difficult. I thinks after the latest app update, the level of support has gone really down. Please fix this Uber! Don't forget, you have alot of competition and will lose customers like me who rely heavily on home deliveries....There are also too many charges",Rated 4 stars out of five stars
3513,"Nothing wrong with the service, though the app itself randomly stopped notifying me when my food has arrived at the door.

3516,I like to use it on occasion. It gets expensive if you use it too much. But it's good when you're in a pinch. If you order from too far it may be a bit cooler by the time it gets to you. So I recommend ordering from somewhere closer to home.. Or wherever you are. It's nice to have. Plus they have an option to have it left on your door step so there's no contact.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars

Orders confirm and says it's being prepped, but then after waiting over an hour for the food to come, it then says no one available to pick up and cancels the order, leaving you stranded thinking where to get food from.

Even with proof they will not look into the claim or even have a human respond.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
3522,This app sucks ass. They dont update the app that match the restaurants deals so you overpay for your food. On top of that you have to pay for delivery fee plus the wait time to get your food. There is an option to pay extra to get your food quicky but it will cost you $2. I paid the $2 and still took 1 hour for my food to get to me. Its not like i was ordering from a play far away.

The fact that Uber has some of the highest paid software engineers, just shows that their interview process must be garbage. Because their android engineers are garbage.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

3536,There is no way to contact live support when you need immediate help.

Edit cart is not straight ahead, normally I need to shutdown the app, reopen it, clear the cart and reorder with the changes I wanted! There is also some menus I feel hard to complete, e.g. if a restaurant offers free drinks, normally I don't have the option to choose the same two drinks, instead I have to order different drinks, etc.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars

I use uber alot, for rides, bikes, and food and the few times I do have a complaint uber support has been nothing but helpful. I used to use posrmates, door dash, grub hub, and all that stuff but uber has one monthly fee and their couriers have MUCH better customer service. They've added many more restaurants and there are so many options to choose from. Love it!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars

The only thing I could complain about is some of the price for delivery cause with some of them being so high I reduced the size of my order because I'm on a fixed income so I have find ways to save money an if that means I order less because of the delivery cost that means the place im ordering from is losing out on money,Rated 5 stars out of five stars

All delivery is 5.00 and up which they try to force you to buy the pass and points accumulates very slowly. I recently switched to Door dash for the last couple of months and they delivery vary from .99 and up. Also double the restaurants and great deals.

So I recommend ordering from somewhere closer to home.. Or wherever you are. It's nice to have. Plus they have an option to have it left on your door step so there's no contact.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars

I used to use posrmates, door dash, grub hub, and all that stuff but uber has one monthly fee and their couriers have MUCH better customer service. They've added many more restaurants and there are so many options to choose from. Love it!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars
4285,"Very bad at tracking issues with orders and needs the user to actively give feedback to inform about obvious problems which should be auto detected and makes it even more frustrating when I have to report that yes, there was a problem, the order took 2 hours to update status and tell me it was cancelled.

Also, it takes about 5 minutes to switch to pick up rather than delivery. Finding a restaurant for pick up is impossible cause you have to use the map. There's no list view.

4294,Great app. Will be helpful if restaurants don't send utensils when not asked for it. The help function is not that helpful.

4459,"I love that it is easily accessible for most foods that I like. It is upsetting that the restaurants can decide to give you a soft drink you do not drink and there isn't much you can do. Perhaps restaurants need to read their orders correctly or the app needs to make sure about the drink orders. Coke has caffeine, people like me can't drink it so we rely on the app and restaurants doing their part.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars

There is back button that takes me back and forth on those two pages. Now i cant even unsub. Which makes it still garbage app. Would give 0 i can,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

Ordered food from a well known establishment but when it arrived not all the items were included. I would have noticed if I got it & sorted there and then. When I raised an issue through the app they said it will take up to 24 hours for a refund of the missing items only. We didn't want a refund we wanted hour food so I had to go back anyway. Who is responsible the driver or Mackies?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
4476,Ordering and looking for food is fine. The issue is setting a primary payment method and being able to change it because I don't seem to be able to.

After some time of waiting (several months) I was able to log in. Then I ordered something and had to put in a payment.

I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it, restarted my phone, and done the basic trouble shooting and it still doesn't help.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
4716,I like to use it on occasion. It gets expensive if you use it too much. But it's good when you're in a pinch. If you order from too far it may be a bit cooler by the time it gets to you. So I recommend ordering from somewhere closer to home.. Or wherever you are. It's nice to have. Plus they have an option to have it left on your door step so there's no contact.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
4717,Experince be good for the most part. However; some restaurants forget some/half of your order; which is very frustrating when you have your mind set on it. The app comes in handy when you dont feel like cooking.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars

Orders confirm and says it's being prepped, but then after waiting over an hour for the food to come, it then says no one available to pick up and cancels the order, leaving you stranded thinking where to get food from. Also app is glitching and not showing orders in history for tracking but sends messages that people are going to get it.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
4721,The app is great for connecting to a restaurant and delivering however the Customer Service sucks once they have deemed there has been too many reported mistakes. You will not be refunded if your order is incorrect or missing an item. Its happened to me several times. Even with proof they will not look into the claim or even have a human respond.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
4722,This app sucks ass. They dont update the app that match the restaurants deals so you overpay for your food. On top of that you have to pay for delivery fee plus the wait time to get your food. There is an option to pay extra to get your food quicky but it will cost you $2. I paid the $2 and still took 1 hour for my food to get to me. Its not like i was ordering from a play far away.

4736,There is no way to contact live support when you need immediate help.

5063,"Credits taken and still charged in full on my card for an order. No option to cancel or update the payment methods on the app. Selecting the options within the help section doesn't help, and just leads you on a loop through different support pages.

Worse, there is no way to see my account info, let alone delete it, or do anything really other than confirm some order details???

Subscribed to free delivery and stuff and after my first order app is stuck on 2 pages. One for my address and one for map as if i am about to order something. There is back button that takes me back and forth on those two pages. Now i cant even unsub. Which makes it still garbage app. Would give 0 i can,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
5075,"App is fine and food choices are excellent, only rated three stars as it is flawed when there is an issue. Ordered food from a well known establishment but when it arrived not all the items were included. I would have noticed if I got it & sorted there and then. When I raised an issue through the app they said it will take up to 24 hours for a refund of the missing items only. We didn't want a refund we wanted hour food so I had to go back anyway. Who is responsible the driver or Mackies?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
5076,Ordering and looking for food is fine. The issue is setting a primary payment method and being able to change it because I don't seem to be able to.

I tried changing my payment when ordering and it didn't really update on the screen.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars

After some time of waiting (several months) I was able to log in. Then I ordered something and had to put in a payment. Payment entry screen was black background and black text so I had no way of knowing if I put in the correct credit card info. So I scanned card and upon checking out payment could not be verified.

Edit cart is not straight ahead, normally I need to shutdown the app, reopen it, clear the cart and reorder with the changes I wanted! There is also some menus I feel hard to complete, e.g. if a restaurant offers free drinks, normally I don't have the option to choose the same two drinks, instead I have to order different drinks, etc.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars

A couple of days ago, however, anytime I want to open WhatsApp, UberEats decides it wants to open too, along with the homepage on Chrome! App doesn't have these permissions whatsoever! I check Play store and install latest update. Seems to fix this 'sentient' app behaviour. Lo and behold, this evening, I open WhatsApp and suddenly UberEats opens!!",Rated 3 stars out of five stars

I use uber alot, for rides, bikes, and food and the few times I do have a complaint uber support has been nothing but helpful. I used to use posrmates, door dash, grub hub, and all that stuff but uber has one monthly fee and their couriers have MUCH better customer service. They've added many more restaurants and there are so many options to choose from. Love it!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars

Also, it takes about 5 minutes to switch to pick up rather than delivery. Finding a restaurant for pick up is impossible cause you have to use the map. There's no list view.

Likely going to switch food courrier services soon.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

5094,Great app. Will be helpful if restaurants don't send utensils when not asked for it. The help function is not that helpful.

5321,The app is great for connecting to a restaurant and delivering however the Customer Service sucks once they have deemed there has been too many reported mistakes. You will not be refunded if your order is incorrect or missing an item. Its happened to me several times. Even with proof they will not look into the claim or even have a human respond.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
5322,This app sucks ass. They dont update the app that match the restaurants deals so you overpay for your food. On top of that you have to pay for delivery fee plus the wait time to get your food. There is an option to pay extra to get your food quicky but it will cost you $2. I paid the $2 and still took 1 hour for my food to get to me. Its not like i was ordering from a play far away.

Likely going to switch food courrier services soon.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

5494,Great app. Will be helpful if restaurants don't send utensils when not asked for it. The help function is not that helpful.

5496,The app interface is really good and easy to search and order. Area of improvement: Estimated order time to delivery is need lot of improvement. Currently the order varies byore than 90-120mins. Service fees is little higher. The restaurants are maybe increasing the item price in Uber when compared to price they show in their website or you call and order them directly.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
5497,"Terrible app. I can't put my address so each time I order something I have to call the driver, because messaging submits the message hours later.

Once I finally found a phone number they said they are not taking support calls and hung up! Then when I put it through the help portion they said they would give me a credit and never did! This is the worst customer service ever!!!!!,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
5668,I used it for quite a long time. Last week I got charged double because the promotion got ignored when charging me. Customer support pretty much doesn't care and after a while just keeps sending copy paste messages telling me there's nothing they can do. I honestly am quite disappointed and pretty much done with this company,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

Subscribed to free delivery and stuff and after my first order app is stuck on 2 pages. One for my address and one for map as if i am about to order something. There is back button that takes me back and forth on those two pages. Now i cant even unsub. Which makes it still garbage app. Would give 0 i can,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
5675,"App is fine and food choices are excellent, only rated three stars as it is flawed when there is an issue. Ordered food from a well known establishment but when it arrived not all the items were included. I would have noticed if I got it & sorted there and then. When I raised an issue through the app they said it will take up to 24 hours for a refund of the missing items only. We didn't want a refund we wanted hour food so I had to go back anyway. Who is responsible the driver or Mackies?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
5676,Ordering and looking for food is fine. The issue is setting a primary payment method and being able to change it because I don't seem to be able to.

I tried changing my payment when ordering and it didn't really update on the screen.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars

Outside the app I visited the website and tried calling. Dead end! I will never use this app again. It is not for me.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

After some time of waiting (several months) I was able to log in. Then I ordered something and had to put in a payment. Payment entry screen was black background and black text so I had no way of knowing if I put in the correct credit card info. So I scanned card and upon checking out payment could not be verified.

I use uber alot, for rides, bikes, and food and the few times I do have a complaint uber support has been nothing but helpful. I used to use posrmates, door dash, grub hub, and all that stuff but uber has one monthly fee and their couriers have MUCH better customer service. They've added many more restaurants and there are so many options to choose from. Love it!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars

Also, it takes about 5 minutes to switch to pick up rather than delivery. Finding a restaurant for pick up is impossible cause you have to use the map. There's no list view.

Likely going to switch food courrier services soon.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

5694,Great app. Will be helpful if restaurants don't send utensils when not asked for it. The help function is not that helpful. I eventually found a place where I could add my own query but it was a mission. It also doesn't seem to be possible to change a rating for the delivery person once he has been rated.

5696,The app interface is really good and easy to search and order. Area of improvement: Estimated order time to delivery is need lot of improvement. Currently the order varies byore than 90-120mins. Service fees is little higher. The restaurants are maybe increasing the item price in Uber when compared to price they show in their website or you call and order them directly.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars

Also the pick up and delivery isn't that accurate, not all the time atleast it can be very laggy. It's improving tho from what it used to be so it's a sign that they are atleast working on this app, keep up the great work I'm sure on no time this app will be close to perfection. I will revise my review then.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
5843,I have ordered from this app faithfully for the last two years at least. The delivery charges was reasonable until recently. All delivery is 5.00 and up which they try to force you to buy the pass and points accumulates very slowly. I recently switched to Door dash for the last couple of months and they delivery vary from .99 and up. Also double the restaurants and great deals. I just paid 1.99 for a delivery and Uber has same restaurant 5.49 delivery. I decided not to use ubereats.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

Worst part is that I can't tip the delivery guy, as the app keeps giving errors whenever I tap ""add tip"".

5926,"You don't provide enough characters to get my full, highly amusing experience, but I've never used this app before, have had my phone number for 15 years minimum but apparently there's an account registered to it that's not my email and there's no way I can fix it. Only got one star cos I can't give less",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
5927,"Please fix the order tracking! after one of the recent updates , the tracker isnt working anymore. The driver will get here with my order but in the app it shows they are still by the restaurant. Please fix this! Other than that it's a good app. Much better than GrubHub and seamless that's for sure. Also my issues with any order was resolved very quickly and properly unlike on the other apps",Rated 4 stars out of five stars
5928,It's a good app just needs to allow you to have more options as far as picking ur food like chipotle for example you cant ask for extra rice like you could on chipotles app & this goes for anything you order from any restaurant. I think the options for you to pick what you want to add or put on the side qould be much more beneficial to everyone iv personally not ordered some times because i didn't have those options,Rated 3 stars out of five stars
5929,For the most part its ok but for a lot of places not everything on the menu is available ..example..Mc donalds...when ordering breakfast and getting a meal theres no option to change your drink to a smoothie or Apple juice. Theres also nowhere to leave a note which is frustrating.,Rated 3 stars out of five stars
5930,"Nothing special, but it's ok as long as you don't run into trouble. I made an order and it turned out the restaurant closed before preparing any food. Now getting help from Uber is very tricky. In the app there is only help regarding how to use the app. In one answer you can find a phone number, call it and a pre-recorded voice will provide help... regarding how to use the app 🤦 Anyhow, if you manage to press the right button you will be able to talk to someone. In India. Gaaaah. Another order",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
5931,"Eally don't know. Can't even login. 1st thing ""link to uber account"" 2nd ""enter email"". Result, can't log in because email already exists.

I make an order from the website, but it says no mobile number attached to account, order from the app. I download the app, enter my number and email address, and then it says the email account is already registered and I can't proceed.

5933,"No ones perfect! I've used the app a few times. It has its glitches, works well otherwise. Note to uber: research the area, get analysis before launching. If you dot have adequate resources (drivers) shut it down so people don't have to wait hours, then find out foods not coming.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
5934,"I've had a terrible experience dealing with bugs on this app. Sometimes it won't let me insert my address, sometimes it'll change my address on me, sometimes it'll cancel an order with an error message after many minutes passed, and I've even had it change from pickup to delivery spontaneously after I walked to the restaurant. The fact that Uber has some of the highest paid software engineers, just shows that their interview process must be garbage. Because their android engineers are garbage.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
5935,I don't like the fact that we get 3 different charges for one order and in total it comes to 4 transactions (if there were no mistakes made) on our bank account. This is very inconvenient for someone who has limited transactions on their Bank account! Otherwise I like the app,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
5936,There is no way to contact live support when you need immediate help. And the help function on the app does not actually have the information that I was looking for which is why it would have been nice to have someone who could have solved my problem. I would rate this a zero if I could based on the level of frustration that I have had in dealing with them previously and by opening up a new account again,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
5937,"3 stars because while I acknowledge the app works and is convenient I am annoyed and unimpressed with all the various fees and will use Mr D going forward. That ""service charge"" is BS and they know it which is why you can't find a clear description of what it is or who it goes to. No thank you.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
5938,"Every restaurant is either closed or unavailable. When I finally find one it says ""no couriers nearby"" which makes ordering impossible. Very counterproductive because there might be a courier when the restaurant is finished with the order. I'm also unable to order alcoholic beverages.

Had to close app and after getting through to place the order all seemed OK... Until the order arrived. I got someone else's which was really similar. Even the email said it was delivered to a different address. My guess, not the restaurant or delivery fault. Likely a system issue given how rubbish the app is.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

5943,I'm not sure if they make it intentionally difficult for you to get a simple email address to be able to get help with your account but I've been on the help website for half an hour along with the app trying to get assistance and every time I just get redirected to their useless help page.

5947,I was deciding what I would eat for dinner and used the uber eats app to help me decide. The app contains several restaurants to choose from and that is what I like most. The app is beginner friendly for those that are afraid of the computer keyboard. I decided to order Jamaican and the food and prices were reasonable. Last but not least the food was exquisite and the delivery driver was kind and courteous,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
5948,"I use this app alot. It's kind of a waste of money in most aspects but that is not the apps fault, the app works just as intended. I would say if you're short on cash you're better off going to grab your food. But this is amazing if you're needing food serotonin and don't want to move.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars
5949,Asked uber to delete my account so I could register to get in. Waited months. Just tried again and my old details are still registered. Uber should not have my info! I finally log in using a new account and try to redeem a special offer only to see that my order has gone through while I'm reviewing my offers. So I've had zero discount and money taken before I could select the offer. Cant cancel cos they're already making the food.

5950,It would be great if I could get food from a place 4.5 miles away but apparently that's too far away! Funny the the place UE recommend is almost 8 miles from my work.

5951,I had problems with the app while entering my address. The app would not indicate what the problem was. I figured it out after 10 mins. I still don't know what I did wrong. Oh and my driver.

5953,Love everything about this app much better than DoorDash and Postmates. You can edit your tip after delivery and if something is missing or isn't right they'll refund you the amount of the item. Their drivers are always nice and will put the food by your door. The app is good because you can track the driver and make your order priority.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
