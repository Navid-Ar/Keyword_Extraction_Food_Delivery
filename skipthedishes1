0,App over the years has just been awful. Customer service is great...when you can get a hold of them. The tracker is awesome...when it works 20%of the time. The app just doesn't seem to function well anymore when on data. Cant get a hold of customer service always shows error or says no connection. The tracker almost never shows the car moving so I dont know when or where my driver is. Taking away the ability to talk to ur driver was bad move although I'm sure I can guess why they did that :P,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1,"I used the app tonight to access a $10 credit on my account. The credit automatically applied to my order. However, when the payment function didn't work (no verification code was sent to my phone) I had to use google pay. By doing this the credit somehow disappeared and I was charged for the entire order without the credit. When I contacted support they could only credit my account again, not refund me the amount I was overcharged. Very frustrating!",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
2,"I usually use it for pick up, but customer service is awful. I started a chat, and they take at least 10 minutes in between my messages to respond. The first chat today got disconnected because they took too long to respond that I became inactive and got kicked out of the chat. The second chat also took half an hour for them to tell me to email support. I thought they were support??",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
3,Since this app came out I've had nothing but issues with it. First time It wasn't excepting my card for the longest time. Then there are other issues it seem everytime I use this app my order gets messed up nd then contacting customers service is the worst ever. They have to waiting 10mind before actually responding back to you then another 30 years before replying back with a simple answer. Just terrible.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
4,"Does the job, could use a dark mode. Also in my opinion the save payment method box should be UNCHECKED by default, or at least an option to toggle which it is would be nice to have. Last point I want to mention is restaurants should still show up in results even if they aren't available for the selected time, so the user can check that restaurant's hours.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
5,"Pretty good selection of restaurants but better apps have the same selection if not more. Layout is simple. Customer service can be a hastle to deal with. Had to talk to 3 customer service reps on all occasions in order to get a proper refund. Refunds will almost always be given in credits or, if you fight for it, you will get a fraction of your money back, if at all. Customer service and service overall is better on other food service apps. Great for debit users.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
6,This app is awesome!! Makes life so much easier that I've installed on my kids phone so they can order *with permission* when life throws you a curve ball and can't have dinner on time or when my husband and I plan a date night and they are thrilled to order. Thank you skip the dishes üôè‚úå,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
7,"The worst part of this app is how addictive it is. I don't have a vehicle, so having an affordable way to eat out is awesome. I like to reward passing a test with a nice meal, and this makes it so easy to get almost anything I am in the mood for. And any time something was missing from my order, skip has given me credit for my next order without hesitation. The drivers are also very friendly!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars
8,I like the app itself its very easy to use and easy to edit your order if you missed an item or need to change one. They are however quite slow in the process. It takes about an hour + to receive your food after you order from the app. Other then that I like it and do use it üôÇ,Rated 3 stars out of five stars

The only thing I dont like is I cant get deals when stuff is on special ie: when Wendy's had Dave's single on for $3 Also one small thing but I wish your drivers would knock so I know its here. You used to send notification when it arrived but that isnt working anymore.",Rated 5 stars out of five stars
12,"The app needs a massive update with their tracker services. It needs to be in real time like Uber Eats, and needs to include delivery driver information beyond that of just their name. I put an order in and the application said the driver was on their way and will be here in 15 minutes. I refreshed a minute or so after and it said 13. After a few minutes the driver arrived yet I was not aware as the app stated they'd arrive much later. Put more information on driver as well.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
13,"Poor customer service. In-app tech support is text only, reps take too long to update customers on what they're doing. At one point, was switched between three reps as every time I asked what was going on, app seemed to send my question to a new rep. Double order error, refund takes too long, app doesn't ask to confirm address when you check out, so if you have more than one address listed in your profile and forget to select one upon opening app, wrong address might be automatically selected.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
14,Well done. App is smooth and has all necessary featured. Good notifications and transitions. Good business. No glaring issues. Only improvment I'd make is perhaps a bigger menu. Can only see about 3 dishes and 2 headers at once.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
15,"The app just decided it would stop accepting my payments. I contacted customer service, and they said I violated terms of service. Which term? They don't know.

19,"On the next update you NEED to put a pull down menu indicating house, duplex, apartment, townhouse complex and if the apartment or townhouse then another pull down where they can input the number.

21,After the apps update it logged me out of my account. I logged back in recently and placed an order. First the restaurant was late making my order and then the courier placed that the food was delivered but I never received my order. I go and check the app to see what gives and see that my old phone number from 4 years ago was apparently defaulted and my new number did not exist. Also the app support crashes.

22,My favorite app to order food from. If there's even a minor problem the skip the dishes staff are on it right away I got full refunds or credit when needed & it didn't take weeks to get either which I was grateful for.

Saved address cannot be modified and notes on saved address do not retain save notes. No ability to report in app if address is incorrect.

106,Update: 1 star now. There's no way to update a new credit card. Absurd! I give this 4 stars only because I use it a lot and it serves it's basic purpose. However there are many areas for improvement. First would be that you should be able to tip the courier AFTER delivery NOT before. Another is that the customer should be able to directly order a previous order without having to search for the restaurant. Basically this app should try to be more user friendly like Uber eats.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

At one point, was switched between three reps as every time I asked what was going on, app seemed to send my question to a new rep.

Thank you skip the dishes üôè‚úå,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
207,"The worst part of this app is how addictive it is. I don't have a vehicle, so having an affordable way to eat out is awesome. I like to reward passing a test with a nice meal, and this makes it so easy to get almost anything I am in the mood for. And any time something was missing from my order, skip has given me credit for my next order without hesitation. The drivers are also very friendly!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars
208,I like the app itself its very easy to use and easy to edit your order if you missed an item or need to change one. They are however quite slow in the process. It takes about an hour + to receive your food after you order from the app. Other then that I like it and do use it üôÇ,Rated 3 stars out of five stars

The only thing I dont like is I cant get deals when stuff is on special ie: when Wendy's had Dave's single on for $3 Also one small thing but I wish your drivers would knock so I know its here. You used to send notification when it arrived but that isnt working anymore.",Rated 5 stars out of five stars
212,"The app needs a massive update with their tracker services. It needs to be in real time like Uber Eats, and needs to include delivery driver information beyond that of just their name. I put an order in and the application said the driver was on their way and will be here in 15 minutes. I refreshed a minute or so after and it said 13. After a few minutes the driver arrived yet I was not aware as the app stated they'd arrive much later. Put more information on driver as well.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
213,"Poor customer service. In-app tech support is text only, reps take too long to update customers on what they're doing. At one point, was switched between three reps as every time I asked what was going on, app seemed to send my question to a new rep. Double order error, refund takes too long, app doesn't ask to confirm address when you check out, so if you have more than one address listed in your profile and forget to select one upon opening app, wrong address might be automatically selected.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

221,After the apps update it logged me out of my account. I logged back in recently and placed an order. First the restaurant was late making my order and then the courier placed that the food was delivered but I never received my order. I go and check the app to see what gives and see that my old phone number from 4 years ago was apparently defaulted and my new number did not exist. Also the app support crashes.

If there's even a minor problem the skip the dishes staff are on it right away I got full refunds or credit when needed & it didn't take weeks to get either which I was grateful for.

However there are many areas for improvement. First would be that you should be able to tip the courier AFTER delivery NOT before. Another is that the customer should be able to directly order a previous order without having to search for the restaurant.

On the odd occasion when there has been a problem with my order, customer service has rectified the problem quickly and to my satisfaction each and every time!!! i also use this app to order food for my kids who live in a different province. its awesome to be able to quickly order a pizza-gift for someone far away!!!!!!!!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars
310,Interestingly people are having trouble with their addresses. Skip app shows my address right away befire I order. I have no #'s on my house. Drivers still find it. Since I know we'll use them again I'm ok with a credit. My daughter and I have been using SKIP since the beginning. I hope it doesn't change after some of these reviews.. I have more poblrms with restaurants getting my orders correct.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
311,"Doesn't work with company VPN - app flat out fails to load (as does the site) unless I bypass my company's VPN. Tried without the VPN and the address input seems to get confused with suite number. Lots of user friction and frustration here. As such, have uninstalled - DoorDash seems to offer a better, more user friendly experience (and works with our VPN - pretty basic requirement these days).",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

Only one really bad experience where we waited over 4.5 hours for no food, skip did return our money in app credits to place a different order though.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars

The app just doesn't seem to function well anymore when on data. Cant get a hold of customer service always shows error or says no connection.

However, when the payment function didn't work (no verification code was sent to my phone) I had to use google pay.

Had to talk to 3 customer service reps on all occasions in order to get a proper refund.

I like to reward passing a test with a nice meal, and this makes it so easy to get almost anything I am in the mood for. And any time something was missing from my order, skip has given me credit for my next order without hesitation. The drivers are also very friendly!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars

332,"The app needs a massive update with their tracker services. It needs to be in real time like Uber Eats, and needs to include delivery driver information beyond that of just their name. I put an order in and the application said the driver was on their way and will be here in 15 minutes. I refreshed a minute or so after and it said 13. After a few minutes the driver arrived yet I was not aware as the app stated they'd arrive much later. Put more information on driver as well.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
333,"Poor customer service. In-app tech support is text only, reps take too long to update customers on what they're doing. At one point, was switched between three reps as every time I asked what was going on, app seemed to send my question to a new rep. Double order error, refund takes too long, app doesn't ask to confirm address when you check out, so if you have more than one address listed in your profile and forget to select one upon opening app, wrong address might be automatically selected.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

First the restaurant was late making my order and then the courier placed that the food was delivered but I never received my order. I go and check the app to see what gives and see that my old phone number from 4 years ago was apparently defaulted and my new number did not exist. Also the app support crashes.

If there's even a minor problem the skip the dishes staff are on it right away I got full refunds or credit when needed & it didn't take weeks to get either which I was grateful for.

412,Always consistent! Deliveries are matched well and the variety provided is amazing. I've never had a problem with skip and I've been using it for two years since I moved. The one hiccup that occurred when a restaurant failed to deliver after accepting pay was swiftly remedied by skip and I was refunded in skip currency. Works for me !,Rated 5 stars out of five stars

I've been trying to use your app several times but it always says that my payment has failed. I already called my bank multiple times, they said the problem is with you.

Tried to talk to skip and they pretty much said suck it, not our problem when it's the app that keeps messing up. Had to delete the app and manually delete all the addresses so it would keep messing up. I would stay away from the skip app, if anything messes up its your fault and they won't do anything to help.

It then makes it impossible to try on the site cause it will says its been processed when it hasn't.

My biggest complaint is that if anything goes wrong, missing food, pick up time sometimes keeps changing making the time even longer, or the driver just going elsewhere and arriving with cold food. There is nothing you can do about it. Its honestly a hit or miss depending on the drivers or restaurants.

However, when the payment function didn't work (no verification code was sent to my phone) I had to use google pay. By doing this the credit somehow disappeared and I was charged for the entire order without the credit.

Had to talk to 3 customer service reps on all occasions in order to get a proper refund. Refunds will almost always be given in credits or, if you fight for it, you will get a fraction of your money back, if at all.

At one point, was switched between three reps as every time I asked what was going on, app seemed to send my question to a new rep.

My biggest complaint is that if anything goes wrong, missing food, pick up time sometimes keeps changing making the time even longer, or the driver just going elsewhere and arriving with cold food. There is nothing you can do about it. Its honestly a hit or miss depending on the drivers or restaurants. Sure you can get a refund but just for that specific item and does not include the tip you gave them.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

The refunds are in the form of credits for future orders, and I think that should change.

However, when the payment function didn't work (no verification code was sent to my phone) I had to use google pay. By doing this the credit somehow disappeared and I was charged for the entire order without the credit.

Had to talk to 3 customer service reps on all occasions in order to get a proper refund. Refunds will almost always be given in credits or, if you fight for it, you will get a fraction of your money back, if at all. Customer service and service overall is better on other food service apps. Great for debit users.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

And any time something was missing from my order, skip has given me credit for my next order without hesitation. The drivers are also very friendly!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars

At one point, was switched between three reps as every time I asked what was going on, app seemed to send my question to a new rep.

My biggest complaint is that if anything goes wrong, missing food, pick up time sometimes keeps changing making the time even longer, or the driver just going elsewhere and arriving with cold food. There is nothing you can do about it. Its honestly a hit or miss depending on the drivers or restaurants. Sure you can get a refund but just for that specific item and does not include the tip you gave them.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars

However, when the payment function didn't work (no verification code was sent to my phone) I had to use google pay. By doing this the credit somehow disappeared and I was charged for the entire order without the credit.

Had to talk to 3 customer service reps on all occasions in order to get a proper refund. Refunds will almost always be given in credits or, if you fight for it, you will get a fraction of your money back, if at all.

At one point, was switched between three reps as every time I asked what was going on, app seemed to send my question to a new rep.

1200,App over the years has just been awful. Customer service is great...when you can get a hold of them. The tracker is awesome...when it works 20%of the time. The app just doesn't seem to function well anymore when on data. Cant get a hold of customer service always shows error or says no connection. The tracker almost never shows the car moving so I dont know when or where my driver is. Taking away the ability to talk to ur driver was bad move although I'm sure I can guess why they did that :P,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1201,"I used the app tonight to access a $10 credit on my account. The credit automatically applied to my order. However, when the payment function didn't work (no verification code was sent to my phone) I had to use google pay. By doing this the credit somehow disappeared and I was charged for the entire order without the credit. When I contacted support they could only credit my account again, not refund me the amount I was overcharged. Very frustrating!",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
1202,"I usually use it for pick up, but customer service is awful. I started a chat, and they take at least 10 minutes in between my messages to respond.

The second chat also took half an hour for them to tell me to email support. I thought they were support??",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1203,Since this app came out I've had nothing but issues with it. First time It wasn't excepting my card for the longest time.

At one point, was switched between three reps as every time I asked what was going on, app seemed to send my question to a new rep.

First the restaurant was late making my order and then the courier placed that the food was delivered but I never received my order. I go and check the app to see what gives and see that my old phone number from 4 years ago was apparently defaulted and my new number did not exist. Also the app support crashes.

The app just doesn't seem to function well anymore when on data. Cant get a hold of customer service always shows error or says no connection. The tracker almost never shows the car moving so I dont know when or where my driver is. Taking away the ability to talk to ur driver was bad move although I'm sure I can guess why they did that :P,Rated 2 stars out of five stars

However, when the payment function didn't work (no verification code was sent to my phone) I had to use google pay.

The refunds are in the form of credits for future orders, and I think that should change.

1597,First off my payments were not working. I had to change from Google to Facebook to just plain old email before I could get the payment to go through. Secondly 80% of my order was wrong and they only credited me for a missing soda pop. I think I'll stick with uber eats as this was not a good experience,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

1600,App over the years has just been awful. Customer service is great...when you can get a hold of them. The tracker is awesome...when it works 20%of the time. The app just doesn't seem to function well anymore when on data. Cant get a hold of customer service always shows error or says no connection. The tracker almost never shows the car moving so I dont know when or where my driver is. Taking away the ability to talk to ur driver was bad move although I'm sure I can guess why they did that :P,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1601,"I used the app tonight to access a $10 credit on my account. The credit automatically applied to my order. However, when the payment function didn't work (no verification code was sent to my phone) I had to use google pay. By doing this the credit somehow disappeared and I was charged for the entire order without the credit. When I contacted support they could only credit my account again, not refund me the amount I was overcharged. Very frustrating!",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
1602,"I usually use it for pick up, but customer service is awful. I started a chat, and they take at least 10 minutes in between my messages to respond. The first chat today got disconnected because they took too long to respond that I became inactive and got kicked out of the chat. The second chat also took half an hour for them to tell me to email support. I thought they were support??",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1603,Since this app came out I've had nothing but issues with it. First time It wasn't excepting my card for the longest time. Then there are other issues it seem everytime I use this app my order gets messed up nd then contacting customers service is the worst ever. They have to waiting 10mind before actually responding back to you then another 30 years before replying back with a simple answer. Just terrible.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1604,"Does the job, could use a dark mode. Also in my opinion the save payment method box should be UNCHECKED by default, or at least an option to toggle which it is would be nice to have. Last point I want to mention is restaurants should still show up in results even if they aren't available for the selected time, so the user can check that restaurant's hours.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars
1605,"Pretty good selection of restaurants but better apps have the same selection if not more. Layout is simple. Customer service can be a hastle to deal with. Had to talk to 3 customer service reps on all occasions in order to get a proper refund. Refunds will almost always be given in credits or, if you fight for it, you will get a fraction of your money back, if at all. Customer service and service overall is better on other food service apps. Great for debit users.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1606,This app is awesome!! Makes life so much easier that I've installed on my kids phone so they can order *with permission* when life throws you a curve ball and can't have dinner on time or when my husband and I plan a date night and they are thrilled to order. Thank you skip the dishes üôè‚úå,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
1607,"The worst part of this app is how addictive it is. I don't have a vehicle, so having an affordable way to eat out is awesome. I like to reward passing a test with a nice meal, and this makes it so easy to get almost anything I am in the mood for. And any time something was missing from my order, skip has given me credit for my next order without hesitation. The drivers are also very friendly!",Rated 5 stars out of five stars
1608,I like the app itself its very easy to use and easy to edit your order if you missed an item or need to change one. They are however quite slow in the process. It takes about an hour + to receive your food after you order from the app. Other then that I like it and do use it üôÇ,Rated 3 stars out of five stars

You used to send notification when it arrived but that isnt working anymore.",Rated 5 stars out of five stars
1612,"The app needs a massive update with their tracker services. It needs to be in real time like Uber Eats, and needs to include delivery driver information beyond that of just their name.

After a few minutes the driver arrived yet I was not aware as the app stated they'd arrive much later. Put more information on driver as well.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1613,"Poor customer service. In-app tech support is text only, reps take too long to update customers on what they're doing. At one point, was switched between three reps as every time I asked what was going on, app seemed to send my question to a new rep. Double order error, refund takes too long, app doesn't ask to confirm address when you check out, so if you have more than one address listed in your profile and forget to select one upon opening app, wrong address might be automatically selected.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars
1614,Well done. App is smooth and has all necessary featured. Good notifications and transitions. Good business. No glaring issues. Only improvment I'd make is perhaps a bigger menu. Can only see about 3 dishes and 2 headers at once.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
1615,"The app just decided it would stop accepting my payments. I contacted customer service, and they said I violated terms of service. Which term? They don't know.

They obviously put all their money into their commercials instead of good or at least decent customer experiences",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

1619,"On the next update you NEED to put a pull down menu indicating house, duplex, apartment, townhouse complex and if the apartment or townhouse then another pull down where they can input the number.

First the restaurant was late making my order and then the courier placed that the food was delivered but I never received my order. I go and check the app to see what gives and see that my old phone number from 4 years ago was apparently defaulted and my new number did not exist. Also the app support crashes.

1622,My favorite app to order food from. If there's even a minor problem the skip the dishes staff are on it right away I got full refunds or credit when needed & it didn't take weeks to get either which I was grateful for.

However there are many areas for improvement. First would be that you should be able to tip the courier AFTER delivery NOT before. Another is that the customer should be able to directly order a previous order without having to search for the restaurant.

1697,NEED HELP? PFFT GOOD LUCK. Chat support hasn't worked in MONTHS!! Haven't been able to chat with customers through the app since April!! Dev team really needs to get on that. Everytime I try to make a request for a missing item it goes through the process then says something went wrong and doesn't process the refund. It then makes it impossible to try on the site cause it will says its been processed when it hasn't. For that I give it 1 star cause you're leaving your customers with zero support,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

The app just doesn't seem to function well anymore when on data. Cant get a hold of customer service always shows error or says no connection.

1989,"Artificially inflated prices (the norm for delivery apps), highest delivery fees in Toronto (minimum $5 in my area near Yonge / Finch) but no additional ""service fee"" like every other app (+1 star for that). Drivers rarely have working gps and show as being in their driveway for the entire delivery, probably an app issue. Bans you if you contact support more than once.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1990,I cant order from this anymore since skip won't take my credit card. I've tried asking their customer service why and they were no help. I've even gone through Google pay. It works for everything else but it won't work for them apparently. And they won't bother to fix it or tell me what the problem even is.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars
1991,"The app does not load on my new phone (LG8 8X thinq) despite uninstalling and reinstalling, clearly cache and ensuring location services are fully on for the app. Nothing seems to make it work. I was a loyal skip user but have now switched to doordash and Uber eats for delivery services as I cannot use the app and the web system is not great for mobile web.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars

1995,"I love Skip, a fantastic idea in world searching for more convenience. Cudos to the creators and to the support team for keeping it running as smooth as it does **** Revoked 5 star..my skip keeps giving me a connection error every login attempt.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1996,"There is an option to submit orders for review if the restaurant makes an error. It used to work and it read great... But it hasn't worked in months, forcing customers to chat to customer service making the whole process much longer. They need to repair this option.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars
1997,First off my payments were not working. I had to change from Google to Facebook to just plain old email before I could get the payment to go through. Secondly 80% of my order was wrong and they only credited me for a missing soda pop. I think I'll stick with uber eats as this was not a good experience,Rated 1 stars out of five stars

1999,Works Well. Just wish there was anything actually done about missed items from the restaurant,Rated 5 stars out of five stars
